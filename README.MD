# Express API

This is a short tutorial on having a basic Node.js API with Express.js. In different branches I show typical problems and solutions on a basic level.

## Configuration

After cloning the repository, use `npm install` and start the API with `npm start` or `nodemon` (if you have nodemon installed). Open the [healthcheck endpoint](http://localhost:5000) in your preferred browser or in [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to check if it's running.

## Endpoints
